Purpose
------------
Candor is a collection of shared libraries I find useful for web applications,
console apps, or windows services that I work on.  It may be useful in other scenarios as well.

You will find much of this code mentioned on the blog at http://candordeveloper.com/.  These libraries are only partially completed and not ready for production use.  Milestone releases are available at http://NuGet.org/profiles/mlang
